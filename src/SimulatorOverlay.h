// letterboxes the panel (the phone presents it at 2x inside a taller screen)

// Panel polarity driven by the host appearance: dark renders the panel
// white-on-black through HalDisplay's inversion flag. A free hook rather than
// a HAL method for the same reason as the rest of this namespace -- following
// a host theme has no analog on real hardware, and the HAL surface must stay
// the firmware's shape.
//
// Takes effect on the very next present, not the next firmware refresh:
// inversion is applied while converting the 1bpp framebuffer to pixels, so
// HalDisplay re-runs that conversion from its cached last frame when the flag
// changes (see reconvertLastFrame in HalDisplay.cpp).
//
// CROSSPOINT_SIM_DARK overrides the argument: "1" forces dark, "0" forces
// normal, unset follows the caller. Both the platform-theme path (the iOS
// harness) and the env path land here, so exercising either verifies the
// other's mechanics.
