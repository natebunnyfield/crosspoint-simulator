// Apply Settings > System > Keep Screen Awake to the host's idle timer.
//
// Mechanism, on iOS: SDL_DisableScreenSaver() sets the video device's
// suspend_screensaver flag and calls the driver's SuspendScreenSaver hook
// (SDL_video.c). The UIKit driver installs UIKit_SuspendScreenSaver for that
// hook (src/video/uikit/SDL_uikitvideo.m), whose entire body is
// `app.idleTimerDisabled = (_this->suspend_screensaver != false)` on
// [UIApplication sharedApplication]. So this IS the iOS API, reached through
// SDL -- no Objective-C and no new iOS surface in this repo. On macOS the same
// two entry points route to the Cocoa driver instead, so the desktop build gets
// the equivalent behavior for free.
//
// IMPORTANT: SDL_VideoInit disables the screensaver *by default* unless
// SDL_HINT_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER is set -- SDL's rationale is that most SDL
// programs are games or media players. Nothing in this repo sets that hint, so
// before this setting existed the app unconditionally held the screen awake.
// Honouring a default-OFF setting is therefore a genuine behavior change on
// the first frame, not a no-op.
//
// Edge-triggered by construction: the per-frame cost is a byte load and an
// integer compare, and SDL is only entered when the owner actually flips the
// row. The -1 sentinel guarantees the first call after startup always applies,
// which is what makes this cover "at startup" as well as "on change".
//
// Main thread only. It is called from main()'s loop alongside presentIfNeeded()
// for the same reason that one is: UIKit/Cocoa must not be touched off-thread.
// It is not in PadCore (which is pure and SDL-free) and it does not read the
// SDL event queue, so HalGPIO keeps sole ownership of the event pump.
// ON iOS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH IS Settings > CrossPoint X3, not the firmware row.
// Sleep behavior is a property of the phone, not of the reader, and it is also
// power-state dependent there — the owner sets it separately for battery and
// for charging, which a single firmware boolean cannot express.
//
// The firmware's "Keep Screen Awake" row is deliberately left alone for now and
// therefore has no effect on iOS. That is a known, temporary overlap: two
// controls for one behavior, pending a ruling on what the firmware row should
// become. Do not "fix" it by deleting either side without that ruling. On the
// desktop simulator the firmware row is still the only control and still works.
