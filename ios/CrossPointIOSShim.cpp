// CrossPoint X3 -> iPhone harness.
//
// THE MODEL. The iPhone impersonates X3 peripherals; it is not a new CrossPoint
// board. There are two surfaces and exactly one translation point between them:
//
//   harness layer (this file)  draws an on-screen button pad and reads touches
//                              on it. Lives outside the simulated device.
//   device layer (HalGPIO)     sees only the X3's seven GPIO buttons, by index.
//
// The harness translates the first into the second by calling HalGPIO's
// platform-neutral live-injection API, gpio.injectButtonDown/Up(BTN_*). The
// device layer cannot tell an injected button from a keyboard one, so no
// #if TARGET_OS_IPHONE appears in HalGPIO or the firmware.
//
// hasTouch() stays false for X3 and iPhone touches become BUTTON events, never
// touch events. Hit-testing happens HERE, above SDL; no coordinate is ever handed
// to the firmware. Letting one reach the hasTouch() branch would make the
// firmware take X4-Pro-only paths and we would be testing a device that does not
// exist.
//
// ONE CONTROL PER PHYSICAL BUTTON, and nothing else. Each is down-on-touch and
// up-on-lift, so it expresses a genuine hold -- which is what page-turn
// autorepeat and long-press-to-sleep need.
//
// POWER is the one control whose GESTURE is widened, because a rectangle on
// glass is not a key you can lean on: a tap holds the injected button past the
// firmware's own sleep threshold instead of lifting with the finger. The device
// layer still sees nothing but an ordinary long press. See kSleepHoldMs.
//
// WHY AN EVENT WATCH, NOT A POLL LOOP. HalGPIO::update() owns the SDL event pump
// for the whole simulator and must keep owning it -- two pollers would split
// events between them. SDL_AddEventWatch observes events as they are queued
// without consuming them, so the harness sees finger events that HalGPIO simply
// ignores, and neither steals from the other.
//
// WHY NOT SDL_PushEvent. The pad used to inject by pushing synthetic
// SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN / _UP. Measured, not assumed: SDL_PushEvent delivers an
// event to the queue but does NOT update SDL's internal keyboard state array,
// which is written only on the real-input path. Edge reads (wasPressed /
// wasReleased) came off the dequeued event and worked; every level read
// (isPressed, getHeldTime, getPowerButtonHeldTime) consults
// SDL_GetKeyboardState() and stayed false, so nothing timed off a HELD button
// could fire -- long-press-to-sleep and the reader's font-family hold both died
// there. injectButtonDown/Up writes the press edge, the held level and the press
// timestamp together, so a hold expressed by a finger survives all the way down.

// layoutPad() for the arrangement.
//
// SIZING follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines: every control is at least

// the Dynamic Island at the top and the home indicator at the bottom.

// --- POWER: a tap sleeps, as well as a hold --------------------------------
//
// THE DEVICE SIDE IS A HOLD AND STAYS A HOLD. The firmware sleeps only once
// getPowerButtonHeldTime() passes SETTINGS.getPowerButtonDuration()
// (crosspoint-reader src/main.cpp:573-582). Nothing else on the device stops
// it: there is no power-off anywhere in the firmware or the SDK, because on an
// ESP32-C3 the only stop state is deep sleep (lib/hal/HalPowerManager.cpp:94)
// and waking from it is a chip reset.
//
// THE PHONE SIDE IS A TAP. A hardware key you can find by feel and lean on is
// not a rectangle on glass. A screen control that needs half a second of
// pressure before anything happens at all does not read as deliberate, it reads
// as broken -- there is no click, no travel and no detent to tell you it is
// working, and the pad is unlabelled, so nothing else offers to explain it.
//
// So the harness widens the GESTURE without inventing a device behaviour: on a
// tap the injected button STAYS DOWN until it has passed the firmware's own
// threshold, then lifts. HalGPIO sees one ordinary long press and the firmware
// runs its ordinary sleep path -- there is no second sleep mechanism here, and
// nothing in this file knows what sleep is. A real hold needs none of this: it
// passes the threshold before the finger lifts.
//
// kSleepHoldMs is read off the firmware rather than invented. 400ms is the
// largest value getPowerButtonDuration() can return (it is 400, or 10 when
// Settings > Controls > "Short power button" is set to Sleep --
// src/CrossPointSettings.h:309-311), and the firmware samples it once per

//
// The inversion is a HOST presentation choice layered on the device's output,
// not a device behaviour -- a fact worth keeping straight, both halves checked
// rather than assumed: no X3 can invert its panel, and nothing in the firmware
// or the SDK calls setInverted/toggleInverted/isInverted; the trio exists only
// in the simulator's HalDisplay, which applies the flip while converting the
// 1bpp framebuffer to pixels. The device layer keeps drawing black-on-white
// and cannot tell the difference, so no firmware path changes underneath us.
//
// Immediacy lives inside HalDisplay, not here. Conversion runs on the render
// task only when the firmware refreshes, so flipping the flag alone would not
// show until the next page render -- which on e-ink may be never. setInverted
// therefore posts an atomic reconvert request that presentIfNeeded (main
// thread) services from HalDisplay's cached last frame, so the new polarity
// lands on the very next present. SimulatorOverlay::setPanelDark is the single
// entry point; it also honours the CROSSPOINT_SIM_DARK override, which is what
