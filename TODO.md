# Open work

Things to do that are not defects. Defects live in [BUGS.md](BUGS.md); this file
is for work that was asked for, or found and ruled worth doing, and has not
landed.

It exists so this repo has the same two trackers the firmware does — `BUGS.md`
for what is broken, `TODO.md` for what is merely owed. Before it existed, the
non-defect findings from the 2026-08-06 audit had nowhere to go and sat in a
plan file on a branch that was later deleted.

Format: `### [ST-NNN] Title` then what it is, why, and what "done" looks like.
An item leaves this file when it ships or when it is ruled out — not when it is
started.

## OPEN

### [ST-001] `HalFrontlight` and `HalTiltSensor` mirror nothing
**scope: HAL surface · found 2026-08-06 · verified 2026-08-07**

`src/HalFrontlight.{h,cpp}` and `src/HalTiltSensor.{h,cpp}` have no counterpart
in the firmware's `lib/hal/`, which holds exactly six HAL classes — Clock,
Display, GPIO, PowerManager, Storage, System. Nothing in the firmware calls
either one, so neither is load-bearing today.

**They should not simply be deleted.** The frontlight is real X4 Pro hardware —
`CLAUDE.md` lists frontlight state among the X4 Pro capabilities, and the SDK
ships `freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/FrontlightManager/`. A simulator that drops it
will need it back the day the firmware grows a brightness control, and the
rebuild will be done by someone who does not know this file existed.

**Close by:** an owner ruling. Keeping them costs four small files; the honest
version of keeping them is a comment at the top of each saying it is a
placeholder ahead of the firmware, so the next reader does not mistake it for a
mirror of something that exists.

### [ST-002] The legacy web-server substitute looks dead and is not
**scope: cruft that must stay · found 2026-08-06 · verified 2026-08-07**

`src/CrossPointWebServer.cpp` is 1083 lines that current CrossPoint builds never
compile — they define `CROSSPOINT_SIMULATOR_PROJECT_WEBSERVER` and use the
firmware's own server against this library's `WebServer`/`WebSocketsServer`
shims instead.

Recorded here **because it reads as obvious cruft and is not.** The macro
disables only this reduced substitute; a downstream consumer that has not
adopted the firmware-owned server still links it. Deleting it breaks those
builds silently, at link time, in someone else's repo.

**Close by:** leave it, and add a header comment saying who still needs it.
Revisit only if every known consumer is confirmed to define the macro.

### [ST-004] Expose the page as UIAccessibility elements (VoiceOver)
**scope: accessibility · follow-on from ST-003 · filed 2026-08-08**

D1 in [the read-aloud plan](.claude/PLAN-tts-read-aloud.md) ruled that
`UIAccessibilityElement` + Speak Screen cannot drive read-aloud: it can neither
turn pages, nor highlight, nor start at a tapped word. That ruling stands and
this is not a second attempt at it.

But the reason it was rejected no longer costs anything to fix. The channel now
publishes the page's text AND a rect per word, which is exactly what an
accessibility element needs. Publishing them would make the reader legible to
VoiceOver, Speak Screen, Braille displays and Switch Control — none of which
read the panel today, because it is one opaque SDL surface with no semantics at
all.

**Close by:** an `UIAccessibilityElement` per word rect (or per line, if
per-word proves chatty under VoiceOver), rebuilt from the same channel drain the
adapter already runs, with `accessibilityFrame` from the same geometry mapping.
Worth checking whether VoiceOver's own reading order fights the read-aloud
highlight when both are on.

## Carried over from the firmware's tracker

`T-004` in the firmware's [TODO.md](../crosspoint-reader/TODO.md) — "make the
simulator stop lying about the device" — is simulator work tracked there because
that is where it was raised. Its substance is `S-001` in this repo's
[BUGS.md](BUGS.md): six places where the simulator reports the opposite of the
hardware, of which the 1 MB free-heap constant is the one that matters, because
every graceful-degradation path on a 380 KB device is unreachable in the only
pre-device gate the project has.

## DONE

### [ST-003] Read-aloud TTS on the iOS harness — DONE
**scope: feature, two repos · asked 2026-08-07 · shipped 2026-08-08**

Apple speech reading the open book on the phone: page spoken in the owner's
Spoken Content voice, auto page-turn, per-word highlight, start from a tapped
word, behind a default-off toggle. Plan, contracts and gates:
[.claude/PLAN-tts-read-aloud.md](.claude/PLAN-tts-read-aloud.md).

WP-1 and WP-2 landed on Linux with gate G0; WP-3 (the AVSpeech adapter) had
never been compiled until 2026-08-08. It compiled and linked on the first real
build — the two defects were both GEOMETRY, and both were invisible everywhere
except on the phone:

- **The highlight scale used `HalDisplay::DISPLAY_HEIGHT`**, which is multiplied
  by `CROSSPOINT_RENDER_SCALE`. Desktop runs at 1x, where that constant equals
  the logical height and the code reads correct; iOS runs at 2x, so every
  highlight came out half-width at half the x-offset. `LOGICAL_HEIGHT` is the
  right constant. This is risk R5 in the plan, and it can only ever appear on
  the 2x build.
- **The firmware capture subtracted the font ascender from `PageLine::yPos`**,
  treating it as a baseline. It is the line's TOP (it is handed straight to
  `block->render()`), so every rect sat a full line high — the highlight lit the
  word above the one being spoken. On the first line it clamped to 0, which hid
  it. Measured against the rendered panel: yPos 0/54/90/126 put ink at
  15/68/104/137, i.e. `yPos + yOffset` plus a few px of leading.

The second one is now pinned by an ink-containment assertion in
`tests/test_read_aloud_capture.sh` — for each rect, the word's own ink band must
sit INSIDE the rect. An overlap test was tried first and was useless: a 26 px
shift against a 35 px line box still clips the word, so it passed on the broken
build.

**Verified on the iOS Simulator:** page spoken; hands-free across 8 consecutive
pages; manual page turn stops and re-speaks; BACK stops and clears; the Settings
toggle turns it off on the first frame after returning; tapping a word jumps to
it (`byteOff=543`, no page turn); the highlight sits exactly on the spoken word.

**NOT verified, and deliberately left so** (owner ruling 2026-08-08 — deferred
to the device pass rather than chased in the simulator):

| Gap | Why it is still open |
|---|---|
| Dark appearance highlight | reachable in the simulator; not run |
| A hyphen-split word lighting BOTH lines | reachable in the simulator; not run. The multi-rect path it exercises is covered by `read_aloud_core` host tests, but not on glass |
| End-of-book timeout | reachable in the simulator; not run |
| Ring/silent switch still audible | needs a physical phone — this is what `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback` is for (R6) |
| The owner's downloaded enhanced/Siri voice | needs a physical phone |

The first three are cheap and should ride along with the device pass, since the
phone has to come out for the last two regardless.
