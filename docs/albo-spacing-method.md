# How space between letters works, and the three measures that got it wrong

Owner, 2026-09-17, after a fitting pass tightened `Vi` until it read too tight:
*"you need to have more optical space between Vi. there is a rhythm to word
images that you are ignoring. research how space between and within letters
works."*

He is right, and this doc exists because the same mistake was made three times
in one day under three different statistics. **Read this before fitting
anything.**

## The principle

**The space between letters is judged against the space inside them.** A page
reads evenly when the white column between two letters belongs to the same
family as the white inside the letters on either side of it. That is why a
spacing rule can never be "every pair gets N units of white": an `o` carries a
large round counter and wants generous flanks, an `i` carries none and wants
little, and the eye is comparing the two whites as it moves.

The corollary, and the one this project kept violating:

> **A letter's own open white belongs to the letter, not to the gap.**

A `V` splays. The triangle of paper under its right arm is part of the letter's
own image — it is what a V looks like — and it is NOT space between the V and
whatever follows. Measure the gap from the V's furthest ink and you will count
that triangle twice: once as the letter's shape and again as spacing, and then
you will "correct" it by jamming the next letter into the V.

## What each letter actually owns

Measured on the shipped italic as *extreme edge minus body edge* — how far the
letter reaches past where its ink actually stands — in em at a 300 px x-height:

| letter | own white, right | own white, left |
|---|---|---|
| o | 0.019 | 0.019 |
| m | 0.026 | 0.034 |
| u | 0.034 | 0.019 |
| n | 0.047 | 0.034 |
| l | 0.063 | 0.070 |
| i | 0.076 | 0.042 |
| A | 0.114 | 0.275 |
| r | 0.153 | 0.033 |
| X | 0.193 | 0.191 |
| **V** | **0.236** | 0.146 |
| L | 0.245 | 0.113 |
| E | 0.279 | 0.093 |
| T | 0.310 | 0.154 |

The V owns **five times** what the n owns and **twelve times** what the o owns.
Any measure that does not subtract this before comparing pairs is measuring the
alphabet's shapes, not its spacing.

## The three measures, and how each failed

### 1. Minimum white (round 198)

The narrowest point between two letters, targeted at 0.136 em — a figure
extrapolated from a regression over sixteen pairs the owner had set by hand,
not measured from the face.

**How it failed.** Minimum white cannot see an open shape at all: it reports the
single closest approach, which for `Vi` happens low down where the V's vertex
passes the i's stem. `Vi` therefore passed while reading twice too loose, and
`um` — two stems whose whole channel is narrow and even — was flagged as fine
while reading too tight. The owner named both, unprompted, from the page.

### 2. Mean gap across the band (round 199)

The average distance between the two letters over the x-height band, targeted at
the face's own `n`/`o` rhythm of 0.144 em.

**How it failed.** It reproduced the owner's three verdicts, which is why it was
believed — and then it drove `Vi` from 0.352 to 0.224 and he said the pair now
needed MORE space. The mean counts every row equally, so the V's splay enters
the average at full weight: 0.236 of the "gap" was the V's own shape. The rule
then removed real spacing to compensate for white that was never spacing.

It also produced a result that should have been read as a warning rather than a
finding: **1,317 pairs wanted 54 units or more of tightening**, ten times the
reader's 255-pair table. A rule that says almost every pair in the font is wrong
is far more likely to be a wrong rule.

### 3. Body-edge gap (round 200, the one to use)

Each letter's edge taken as a percentile of its ink over the band — where the
letter *stands* rather than where it *reaches* — and the gap measured between
those. The splay stays with the letter.

On this measure the rhythm letters land at `oo` 0.077, `no` 0.104, and `Vi`
reads 0.252 before any change: genuinely loose, but by a third of what the mean
gap claimed, and the correction is a third of the size.

## What this means for fitting

1. **Space by the letter, not by the pair.** A sidebearing is a property of the
   letter and should be proportional to the white that letter owns on that side.
   Kerns are for the exceptions a pair of shapes creates, and there should be
   tens of them, not thousands.
2. **A rule that wants to move everything is broken.** The 255-pair table is not
   just a device limit; it is a sanity bound. If a fit wants 1,317 exceptions,
   stop and question the measure.
3. **The owner's eye is the gate.** All three statistics agreed with the numbers
   and two of them disagreed with him. When a measure and his reading of the page
   diverge, the measure is what changes.

## What is in the font now

Round 200 withdraws the round-199 capital pass, which rested on measure 2, and
its `Vi` kern of −126. Two things from that round survive because he asked for
them by name and they are right on any measure:

* **J's right bearing at −74**, which fixes `Ju` (mean gap 0.226 → 0.152).
* **`um` +30**, which opens the pair he called too tight, to 0.144 exactly.

`Vi` is back at 0.352 mean gap — loose by measure 3 as well, and the next thing
to fit, but with a correction near 80 units rather than 126, and taken out of
V's own bearing rather than out of the pair.

The sixteen pairs and five bearings the owner set at his bench (round 198) are
untouched throughout.

## The larger finding, which measure 3 does not remove

Albo's italic counters measure **145 units against Flanker Griffo's 226** at the
same x-height, while its absolute inter-letter white is **127 against Flanker's
167** — the second tightest of the five reference italics. The letters are
narrow relative to their fitting. No table can fix that, and it is the reason
every spacing rule tried so far wants to close gaps that are not really open.
That is a drawing decision.
